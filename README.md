# LibreCybernetics

LibreCybernetics aims to become a worker-owned-cooperative of Libertarian Cybernetic
Socialists with the goal of developing both comrades technical abilities and
liberatory technologies with the following principles:

 - Strive towards a Libertarian Communism / Left Communism / Council Communism /
   Libertarian Marxism Future. (Broadly a Libertarian Left Future)

 - Use functional programming and formal verification as much possible.

 - Use Copyfarleft / copyfair licenses as much as possible.

This is an experiment in developing libre(1) software for the commons and
getting a living-wage. (Not there yet)
